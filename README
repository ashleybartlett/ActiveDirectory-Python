This is a Python package for interacting with Active Directory via LDAP.
It focuses almost exclusively on password/account policy.

It does supports both domain-wide and fine-grained password policies:
  - Domain-wide: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682209(v=vs.85).aspx
  - Fine-grained: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754544(v=ws.10).aspx

Requirements:
  - Python Packages:
    - python-ldap
  - Python Modules:
    - OrderedDict (python 2.7+ or RHEL/CentOS python-libs >= 2.6.6-43)

Runtime Requirements:
  - Your users can change their own password (SELF can Change Password in AD ACLs)
  - You bind to Active Directory:
    - As a user who can look up password policies (domain-wide and fine-grained).
    - As a user who can change your users' passwords.
    - Using some form of SSL. Either STARTTLS on port 389 or TLS/SSL on port 636.

Tests:
  - This uses unittest2.
  - In this directory (python 2.6): unit2 discover -t .
